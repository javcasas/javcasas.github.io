    <p>I am Javier Casas. I am a Software Engineer, technologist, and jack of all technological trades. I enjoy writing software, electronics, learning and building. Building as in creating.</p>
<p>I was born in Spain, started playing with electronics with some old Radiorama magazines, and continued my passion later with computing, and software developing.
My first programming environment was QBasic, on the MS-DOS shell embedded in Windows 95.
From there, I jumped to C and DIV. Later, while doing my degree I finally got hold of an Internet connection, and started playing with more advanced languages.
I learned a bit about C++, Java, Pascal, assembly for x86 and UltraSPARC, as well as a bit of Eiffel.
Finally, for my University project I wrote an OpenGL object model and game engine in OCaML, with bits of Python to interface with Blender.
Since then I have worked in embedded systems, using initially Vala to (indirectly) compile to ARM, and then Python to write Web UIs and backend code for big embedded (appliance-like) systems.</p>
<p>I currently work for ApplianSys, in Coventry (UK), where we develop nice appliances for web caching and managing DNS using Python and our deeply-modified flavour of Linux.</p>
